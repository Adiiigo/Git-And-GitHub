# reflections
1)When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--Remote repository helps us to make the project many people working on easy.As many people can add their work and thus HUB is created.

2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--So that we are aware of the commits actually getting into our computer
