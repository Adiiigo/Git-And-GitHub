# reflections
1)When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--Remote repository helps us to make the project many people working on easy.As many people can add their work and thus HUB is created.

2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--So that we are aware of the commits actually getting into our computer

3)Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-- Forks - It is used to clone a repository from one GITHUB a/c to another.
   Clones - It is used to make a copy of git repository from GITHUB a/v to your machine.
   Barnches - It is used to make changes on the master file but not making changes on the master file

4)What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-- Easier for us to be updated with the team making changes.

5)How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
-- It'll be very hard.
