1)How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
--In linux terminal , I myself saw the difference between the two files and and two diff. versions makes it easier to see the bugs as i might not remember what changes i made previously. It becomes easier and thus faster to find the differnce and correct and realize why i did it.

2)How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
--Benefits are that i can see and check who all are the efficient people working on the project and check the changes made. I can easily remember why i switched from previous code to newer one and easily rectify my mistakes and do not do that in future.

3)What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
--Because doing so I m to decide when to commit , what to commit and from which name it should be identified.

4)Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
--Because it is easy to find files and correpsonding changes done in other files.Otherwise we have to scan all the files and match their commit times

5)How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-- 'git log' - This is used to show all the commit history along with its date and time of commit and Name which is utmost important to identify why that commit was made.
	'git diff' - when we have found out the commit history we need to see the changes that were made and compare the two files.
	
6)How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
-- by using version control system,i can make as many changes i want and not to worry about what was the previous code was.

7)Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
-- Using it for the project that is already been done but need some updations and modifications.
